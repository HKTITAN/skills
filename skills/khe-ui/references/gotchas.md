# Gotchas

This file is **append-only**. Each time the agent (or you) gets a detail wrong in practice, add a one-line gotcha here. Do not edit an entry unless it is outright wrong. Negative examples are the highest-signal content in a skill over time: the instructions should change rarely and this file should grow steadily.

## Format

```text
- [YYYY-MM-DD] One-line description of the gotcha. → the fix, and the reference that owns the rule
```

Keep each to one line. Taste calls go in [pov](pov.md), not here.

## Entries

- [2026-11-11] A cache-first service worker shows returning users the old CSS for one load after a restyle, even with the cache name bumped. → bump CACHE every deploy and expect one stale paint; verify production on a second reload (polish-and-ship)
